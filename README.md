## ⚫ Who I Am

A quiet mind with sharp logic.
A detective of patterns.
A programmer who builds in the shadows.

I don’t code loudly.
I don’t publish randomly.
Every file here exists for a reason — deduction, precision, and mastery.
...
## 🖤 Philosophy

I do not guess.
I observe.
I deduce.
Then I execute — cleanly and without hesitation.

This account holds my college work, but it carries my standards, not anyone else’s.
